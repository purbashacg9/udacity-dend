# udacity-dend
This repository contains the Capstone project done for Udacity Data Engineering Nano Degree. 

The purpose of the project is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from multiple data sets and transforms them into analytical tables containing information on immigration to United States.

The analytical tables are stored in a data lake on S3.

For purpose of this workspace, the data is being stored in the output folder. The immigration data in the output folder contains only one file to limit the size of the repository.

See capstone-project-instructions.md for the instructions for the Udacity Project.
